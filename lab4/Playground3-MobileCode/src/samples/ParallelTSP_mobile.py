"""REM_START
This is the mobile code for ParallelTSP. It is intended to be run on a mobile
code server and return the result.

However, it may also be imported by the local client for local/remote shared
computations. (e.g., "maxPaths()" is a useful function both remote and
locally).

Comments marked with REM_START/REM_END can be removed. Templated values can
be inserted into places appropriately marked

    but because of symmetry, it is halved.

    iterating through paths.
